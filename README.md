# Real_Estate_Calculator

Calculate property investment returns with ease using the Real Estate Calculator.

## Introduction

The Real Estate Calculator is a tool designed to help real estate investors calculate their potential returns on property investments.
This was done as a random thought just to see without interest how long it would take to pay off an average house in london with an average salary of three people.
It also calculates how long it would take with the continued payments and new payments from new rented out properties to start buying new houses yearly by rent assests alone.
i.e. at what point can the three people stop investing their active income and let the passive income from rent pay for new investments.
